# JoÃ£o Victor - PhD Candidate, Senior Data Scientist

Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ I'm JoÃ£o Victor, a PhD candidate specializing in molecular dynamics simulations at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) and a Senior Data Scientist at Will Bank. I have a deep passion for computational vision, physics, statistics, and of course, the power of Linux.

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Background

I am currently working on my PhD in molecular dynamics simulations at USP. I'm always open to discussing my research, future projects, or just the general field of computational physics.

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience

As a Senior Data Scientist at Will Bank, I use my academic background in physics and my love for computational vision and statistics to make sense of complex data, identify patterns, and drive strategic decision-making. I am always eager to explore new ways to use data and machine learning to solve challenging business problems.

## ðŸ’¡ Interests

- Computational Vision: As a data scientist, I am fascinated by how computers can be taught to "see" and understand the world around us. I enjoy using these techniques to solve real-world problems.

- Physics: My passion for physics doesn't stop at molecular dynamics. I am constantly interested in exploring how the fundamental laws of the universe can be applied to new and exciting areas.

- Statistics: The backbone of all good data science, I enjoy diving deep into statistical theory and practice.

- Linux: I believe in the power of open-source and I am a strong advocate for Linux. I love its flexibility, community-driven development, and the power it gives to its users.
